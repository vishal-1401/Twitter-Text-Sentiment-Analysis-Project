# Twitter-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Project
Twitter Text Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning project that analyzes tweet text to classify sentiments as positive or negative. It uses NLP techniques, TF-IDF features, and ML models with a Streamlit web interface for real-time sentiment prediction.

# Objectives

Analyze sentiment of tweet text
Preprocess and clean unstructured text data
Train ML model for sentiment classification
Provide real-time prediction using a web interface

# Technologies Used

Python
Machine Learning
NLP (Natural Language Processing)
Streamlit
Scikit-learn

# Features

Text cleaning (stopwords, punctuation, URLs)
TF-IDF / Bag of Words feature extraction
Sentiment classification (Positive / Negative)
Interactive UI for user input
Fast and accurate predictions

# Model & Approach

Data preprocessing and normalization
Feature extraction using TF-IDF
Classification using Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM
Model evaluation using accuracy and F1-score
